# Team

**Overview of the Core Contributors**

The Undal Network is driven by a passionate group of developers and contributors who share a vision for a decentralized future. Our core team, comprised of individuals with diverse backgrounds in blockchain technology, software development, and community engagement, is committed to fostering an ecosystem where every participant has a voice. The development of the network leverages open-source code, with contributions available on platforms like GitHub, promoting transparency and collaboration.

**Advisory Board and Key Partnerships**

We are proud to collaborate with several key partners that share our vision of decentralization and innovation. Notably, our partnership with Ethereum enables us to utilize robust open-source code, ensuring the reliability and security of our network. Additionally, we will integrate with decentralized exchanges (DEXs), allowing for seamless trading of WYRD tokens, further emphasizing our commitment to a decentralized marketplace.

**A Decentralized Approach: Empowering the Community**

In line with our foundational principles, the Undal Network operates without a centralized team or management. We are not conducting sales or fundraising activities, and there is no pre-mine allocation. This truly fair launch model invites you—whether as an investor, trader, miner, or holder—to actively participate in our community and fill essential roles.

Our governance model will be handled through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which will empower community members to make decisions and shape the future of the Undal Network. In our commitment to true decentralization, we will remove any need for a single designated human contact point to ensure the project's continuity. Once the DAO is established, only token holders will have the authority to govern the project, solidifying our goal of achieving a decentralized and community-driven network.
