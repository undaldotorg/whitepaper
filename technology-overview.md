# Technology Overview

**Core Technologies Behind Undal (WYRD)**

The **Undal (WYRD)** network leverages advanced blockchain technologies to create a robust, decentralized, and secure platform. At its core, the network combines the following technologies:

1. **Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus Mechanism**
   * The Undal network utilizes a PoW consensus mechanism to ensure decentralization and security. This approach allows miners to compete to validate transactions and create new blocks, fostering an equitable environment for network participants. The PoW mechanism enhances the integrity of the blockchain by making it resistant to attacks and manipulation.
2. **Zero-Knowledge (zk) Layer**
   * The implementation of a zero-knowledge layer as a second layer (L2) solution enhances user privacy and transaction confidentiality. This technology allows users to prove the validity of transactions without revealing any sensitive information, thereby addressing growing concerns about privacy in the blockchain space. The zk layer ensures that the Undal network remains competitive by appealing to users who prioritize privacy in their transactions.
3. **EVM Compatibility**
   * The Undal network is designed to be fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to easily deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform. This compatibility allows for seamless integration with existing Ethereum-based projects, encouraging developers to migrate or expand their applications onto the Undal network.
4. **Decentralized Governance**
   * The Undal network promotes decentralized governance, allowing stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes related to protocol upgrades and modifications. This approach enhances transparency and community involvement, ensuring that the network evolves in a manner that reflects the interests of its users.

**Technical Specifications**

* **Block Time**: The Undal network is designed to achieve a block time of approximately 10 minutes, striking a balance between security and transaction speed.
* **Transaction Throughput**: The network aims to support a high transaction throughput, facilitating fast and efficient transactions while minimizing congestion.
* **Smart Contract Language**: The Undal network will utilize a familiar programming language for smart contract development, making it accessible to a broad range of developers.

**Security Features**

* **Encryption and Hashing**: The Undal network employs advanced encryption and hashing algorithms to secure user data and transactions. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and that transaction integrity is maintained.
* **Multi-Signature Support**: To enhance security, the network supports multi-signature wallets, allowing multiple parties to authorize transactions before they are executed. This feature mitigates risks associated with single-point failures.

**Scalability Solutions**

* **Layer 2 Solutions**: In addition to the zk layer, the Undal network will explore other layer 2 solutions to further enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs. This includes sidechains and state channels, allowing for off-chain transactions while maintaining the security of the main blockchain.
