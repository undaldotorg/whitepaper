# Governance Model

The governance of the Undal Network will evolve into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure, empowering the community to play an active role in the decision-making processes that shape the future of the ecosystem. This approach reflects our commitment to true decentralization, where every participant has a voice and a stake in the networkâ€™s development.

**Foundational Principles**

The Undal governance model is built on several foundational principles:

1. **Decentralization:** The network is designed to eliminate central authority, ensuring that no single entity can dictate the rules or direction of the Undal ecosystem. Decisions will be made collectively, reflecting the consensus of the community.
2. **Transparency:** All governance processes will be open and transparent, allowing community members to understand the decision-making process and hold each other accountable.
3. **Inclusivity:** We strive to create an inclusive environment where all participants, regardless of their level of investment or expertise, can contribute to discussions and decisions.

**Establishment of the DAO**

As the Undal Network matures, we will initiate the formation of a DAO. This will involve several key steps:

1. **Community Engagement:** To establish a strong foundation for the DAO, we will actively engage with our community through forums, surveys, and discussions. Gathering feedback will be essential to understanding the needs and priorities of our participants.
2. **Token-based Voting System:** Once the DAO is established, WYRD token holders will be granted voting rights proportional to their holdings. This token-based voting system will empower community members to propose and vote on various initiatives, such as:
   * Protocol upgrades and improvements
   * Allocation of community funds for projects and initiatives
   * Partnerships and collaborations with other projects
   * Strategic direction and vision for the Undal Network
3. **Proposal Mechanism:** Community members will be able to submit proposals for consideration by the DAO. These proposals will be subject to a voting process, where participants can express their support or opposition. A transparent and fair evaluation process will ensure that proposals align with the overall vision of the network.
4. **Implementation of Decisions:** Once proposals are approved through the voting process, the DAO will facilitate the implementation of these decisions. This may involve coordinating with developers, allocating funds, and ensuring that the agreed-upon changes are executed effectively.
5. **Continuous Feedback Loop:** The governance model will include mechanisms for continuous feedback and adaptation. Regular community meetings and discussions will be held to assess the effectiveness of decisions, gather insights, and adjust the governance framework as needed.

**No Native Token Allocation**

A crucial aspect of the Undal DAO is that, due to the fair launch of the WYRD token, there will be no initial allocation of native tokens to the DAO itself. This design choice emphasizes that the strength and effectiveness of the DAO will be rooted in community support and participation. Without an active CEO or centralized leadership, much like Bitcoin, the community will take on the responsibility of developing and advancing various aspects of the project within an open-source and public environment.

**Ownership Renouncement**

Once the DAO is fully deployed, ownership of the Undal Network will be renounced, eliminating any super admin role from the project. This transition will ensure that native token holders can truly lead the project, fostering an environment of genuine community governance and involvement. The DAO will function as intended, allowing stakeholders to collectively guide the evolution of the network without interference from a centralized authority.

**Roadmap for DAO Development**

The roadmap for transitioning to a DAO structure includes the following milestones:

1. **Phase 1: Community Building**
   * Engage with the community to build awareness and support for the DAO concept.
   * Establish communication channels for discussion and feedback.
2. **Phase 2: Governance Framework Development**
   * Define the governance framework, including voting mechanisms, proposal processes, and community guidelines.
   * Conduct workshops or webinars to educate the community on the governance model and its benefits.
3. **Phase 3: DAO Launch**
   * Officially launch the DAO, allowing token holders to participate in governance activities.
   * Implement the token-based voting system and establish the proposal mechanism.
4. **Phase 4: Ongoing Development and Improvement**
   * Continuously evaluate and improve the governance model based on community feedback.
   * Explore additional features, such as delegation mechanisms or committees, to enhance governance efficiency.

**Conclusion**

The transition to a DAO represents a significant step towards achieving true decentralization within the Undal Network. By empowering our community to take an active role in governance, we aim to foster a collaborative environment that drives innovation and aligns with the values of our participants. As the network grows, we are committed to ensuring that the governance model evolves in response to the needs of the community, creating a resilient and sustainable ecosystem for all.
