# Use cases

The Undal Network is designed to empower users with a versatile platform that transcends traditional financial systems and enhances existing blockchain visions. By focusing on accessibility, affordability, and decentralized governance, the Undal Network aims to create a multitude of use cases that cater to diverse user needs, fostering an inclusive ecosystem for all participants.

**1. Peer-to-Peer Digital Cash**

At its core, the Undal Network serves as a robust platform for peer-to-peer (P2P) digital cash transactions. By enabling instant, secure, and low-cost transfers, users can engage in seamless transactions without the constraints of traditional banking systems. This capability aligns with the original vision of Bitcoin while addressing current challenges such as high fees and lengthy processing times.

**2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**

The Undal Network aims to broaden access to DeFi applications by reducing transaction costs to a fraction of a cent. Users will be able to engage in lending, borrowing, and yield farming without the barriers presented by high fees, thus promoting financial inclusivity. This empowers individuals from various economic backgrounds to participate in the DeFi ecosystem and benefit from its offerings.

**3. Web3 Accessibility**

We strive to enhance Ethereum’s vision of a decentralized web (Web3) by making it accessible to anyone with a smartphone. The Undal Network will support developers in creating decentralized applications (dApps) that run efficiently on our blockchain, enabling a wide range of functionalities such as social networks, content creation platforms, and more. By reducing the cost of interactions within these dApps, we facilitate broader user engagement and participation.

**4. Microtransactions and Content Monetization**

The ultra-low transaction fees on the Undal Network open up new possibilities for microtransactions, allowing users to exchange small amounts of value seamlessly. This feature can be particularly beneficial for content creators, enabling them to monetize their work through tips, subscriptions, and pay-per-view models without incurring prohibitive costs. Such a framework fosters a more equitable distribution of revenue among creators and consumers.

**5. Tokenization of Assets**

The Undal Network allows for the easy tokenization of physical and digital assets, democratizing access to investment opportunities. Users can tokenize real estate, art, or other valuable items, making them accessible to a wider audience. This process can be streamlined and made cost-effective, encouraging investment and participation from individuals who may have previously been excluded from traditional asset markets.

**6. Community Governance and Participation**

Through the DAO model, the Undal Network emphasizes community engagement and governance. Users can actively participate in decision-making processes, propose changes, and influence the direction of the network. This participatory approach fosters a sense of ownership and collective responsibility among users, ensuring that the network evolves in alignment with community needs.

**7. Cross-Chain Interoperability**

The Undal Network will facilitate seamless interoperability with other blockchains, enhancing its utility and reach. By connecting with existing networks through bridges like CCIP and Wormhole, users can engage in multi-chain transactions, access diverse DeFi services, and leverage the strengths of various ecosystems. This interoperability expands the use cases and benefits available to users, further solidifying the Undal Network's position in the broader blockchain landscape.

#### **8. NFTs and Real-World Assets (RWAs)**

The Undal Network will support non-fungible tokens (NFTs), enabling the creation, sale, and transfer of unique digital representations of real-world assets. These NFTs could represent ownership of tangible items such as real estate, collectibles, art, or even shares in physical businesses. By utilizing the Undal Network’s ultra-low transaction fees, creators and owners can mint and trade NFTs without being hindered by high costs, thereby democratizing access to asset ownership.

This capability will empower individuals to invest in and trade fractionalized ownership of valuable physical assets, making investments more accessible to a broader audience. By leveraging the Undal Network's decentralized infrastructure, ownership of these RWAs will be secure, transparent, and immutable, enhancing trust in transactions.

#### **9. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**

The Undal Network is committed to maintaining the ethos of decentralization by ensuring that all trading activities occur on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Users will be able to trade WYRD and other tokens directly on-chain, without relying on centralized intermediaries that could pose risks of manipulation or custody. By fostering a fully decentralized trading environment, the network will enhance liquidity while maintaining user control over assets.

DEXs also support liquidity pools, enabling users to contribute liquidity to the market and earn rewards. The focus will be on a seamless, user-friendly experience, ensuring that even individuals with minimal blockchain knowledge can participate in trading, liquidity provision, and yield farming without being overburdened by fees or complexity.\
