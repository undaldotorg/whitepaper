# Roadmap

**Phase 1: Initial Development and Launch**

* **Duration**: 3 months
* **Activities**:
  * **Prelaunch Viral Marketing**:
    * Implement an extensive marketing campaign to build awareness and excitement within the community.
    * Engage potential users and miners through social media, online forums, and targeted outreach.
  * **Final Development**:
    * Complete the core development of the Undal Network, ensuring all foundational components are functional and secure.
    * Test the blockchain to ensure stability and reliability before launch.
  * **Launch Preparation**:
    * Finalize partnerships with mining pool operators and community members for a robust launch.

**Phase 2: zk-Layer Implementation and Ecosystem Expansion**

* **Duration**: 3 to 6 months post-launch
* **Activities**:
  * **Deploying the Chain and Mining Pool**:
    * Officially launch the Undal Network and initiate the mining pool to kickstart ecosystem participation.
    * Monitor network performance and stability during the initial launch phase.
  * **zk-Layer Integration**:
    * Begin implementing the zero-knowledge layer to enhance privacy features within the network.
    * Collaborate with developers to integrate zk-technology seamlessly into the existing ecosystem.
  * **Ecosystem Expansion**:
    * Explore opportunities for partnerships with developers and projects to broaden the ecosystemâ€™s offerings.
    * Promote community engagement through educational initiatives and resources on using the network.
    * Ensure that the Undal Network is added to as many mining pools as possible, enhancing participation and further decentralizing network management.

**Phase 3: Further Decentralization and Network Growth**

* **Duration**: Ongoing after Phase 2
* **Activities**:
  * **Funding the DAO**:
    * Facilitate community participation in funding the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) through donations.
    * Create incentives for community members to contribute to the DAO's funding and development.
  * **Renouncing DAO Ownership**:
    * Officially renounce ownership of the DAO to empower community governance and decision-making.
    * Transition into a fully community-led initiative, allowing token holders to shape the future of the Undal Network.
  * **Outsourcing Ecosystem Components**:
    * Support significant parts of the ecosystem, such as network nodes and the explorer, by outsourcing to independent third parties.
    * Utilize Etherscan for the explorer to provide transparency and functionality for users.
    * Ensure that the network remains resilient and sustainable over time by diversifying operational responsibility among various stakeholders, much like Bitcoin, where everyone supports the network independently.
