**Token Details**

* **Token Name:** Undal
* **Symbol:** WYRD
* **Total Supply:** The maximum supply of WYRD is capped at **21 million tokens**, mirroring Bitcoin's scarcity model. This ensures that as the network matures, the value of the token is preserved over time.

**Block Generation**

* **Block Time:** Undal will maintain a block time of **10 minutes**, consistent with Bitcoin, to enhance familiarity for users transitioning from established networks.

**Reward Structure and Halving Phases**

The reward system for Undal (WYRD) will begin at **100 WYRD per block**, similar to Bitcoin's initial reward. The following outlines the halving schedule and phases:

1. **Phase 1: Initial Launch**
   * **Block Reward:** **100 WYRD** per block
   * **Halving Event:** Occurs after the first **210,000 blocks** (approximately every 4 years).
   * **Duration to Halving:** Approximately **3.98 years**.
   * **Total Supply at this Stage:** **21 million WYRD** will be gradually mined over time.
2. **Phase 2: First Halving**
   * **Block Reward:** Reduced to **50 WYRD** per block.
   * **Halving Event:** After the next **210,000 blocks**.
   * **Duration to Halving:** Approximately **3.98 years**.
   * **Estimated Total Supply:** Around **10.5 million WYRD** will be in circulation.
3. **Phase 3: Second Halving**
   * **Block Reward:** Reduced to **25 WYRD** per block.
   * **Halving Event:** Following the next **210,000 blocks**.
   * **Duration to Halving:** Approximately **3.98 years**.
   * **Estimated Total Supply:** Around **15.75 million WYRD** will be in circulation.
4. **Phase 4: Third Halving**
   * **Block Reward:** Reduced to **12.5 WYRD** per block.
   * **Halving Event:** After another **210,000 blocks**.
   * **Duration to Halving:** Approximately **3.98 years**.
   * **Estimated Total Supply:** Around **17.85 million WYRD** will be in circulation.
5. **Phase 5: Fourth Halving**
   * **Block Reward:** Reduced to **6.25 WYRD** per block.
   * **Halving Event:** After the next **210,000 blocks**.
   * **Duration to Halving:** Approximately **3.98 years**.
   * **Estimated Total Supply:** Approximately **18.85 million WYRD** will be in circulation.
6. **Final Phases: Subsequent Halvings**
   * The reward will continue to halve every **210,000 blocks**, following the Bitcoin model until the maximum supply of **21 million WYRD** is reached.
   * **Estimated Duration for Full Supply:** The complete mining of the total supply is expected to occur approximately **until the year 2140**, similar to Bitcoin’s timeline.

**Liquidity Considerations for Newly Mined Coins**

To encourage a stable and healthy market environment, newly mined WYRD coins will have a spendability period of **six months** following their creation. This extended timeframe, which surpasses the typical practice of 50 blocks, aims to gently encourage holders to maintain their assets, contributing to a more balanced market dynamic.

**Incentive Mechanisms**

* **Mining Incentives:** The Undal network will incentivize miners to participate actively by offering block rewards and transaction fees, ensuring network security and reliability.
* **Community Engagement:** To further enhance community involvement, a portion of transaction fees may be allocated to community-driven initiatives, such as educational programs, development grants, or marketing efforts.

**Long-term Vision**

The tokenomics of Undal (WYRD) is structured to promote long-term sustainability and value creation. By aligning with proven economic principles and prioritizing decentralization, the Undal network aims to cultivate a resilient ecosystem that benefits all participants.
